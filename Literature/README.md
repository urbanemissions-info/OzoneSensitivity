### Examining TROPOMI formaldehyde to nitrogen dioxide ratios in the Lake Michigan region: implications for ozone exceedances

1. Compared O3 sensitivity on weekdays and weekends. NO2 sensitive on weekends.
2. Compared O3 sensitivity on O3 season days and O3 exceedance days.
3. HCHO and NO2 have similar lifetimes in order of hours
4. O3 season is defined as the time period in which most number of O3 exceedance days are present. O3 exceedance day is defined as a day on which atleast one ground monitor reports an MDA O3 level > NAAQS standard (70ppbv)
5. O3 sensitivity through FNR is prone to errors. But these errors are less in Urban areas. 
6. Cloud fraction considered - <0.5
7. To compare the differences in means Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test (K-S) was used. Null Hypothesis: Two samples come from same population. 
8. 


| FNR threshold  |  O3 sensitivity |
|---|---|
| FNR < 3.2 | VOC-sensitive |
| 3.2 < FNR < 4.1 | Transition zone |
| FNR > 4.1 | NOx-sensitive |

### Mirrezaei - Ozone production over arid regions

1. They used OMI data as well, apart from TROPOMI
2. Aridity Index (AI) - to determine the level of aridity of a region. It is calculated by dividing Mean Annual precipitation by Mean Annual Reference Evapotranspiration (PET). Global Aridity Index has this data. 

| AI  |  Aridity |
|---|---|
| AI < 0.03 | Hyper-arid |
| 0.03 < AI < 0.2 | Arid |
| 0.2 < AI < 0.5 | Semi-Arid |
| 0.5 < AI < 0.65 | Dry sub-humid |
| 0.65 < AI | Humid |
| 0.65 > AI | Drylands |
As per UNEP

3. Delhi is a dryland
4. More aridity (and elevated temperatures) => More ozone concentration, through acceleration of photochemical reactions. But, Elevated humidity levels have potential to enhance clouds and act as a proxy for HOx -- whihc may result in the efficiency of photochemical reactions.
5. Issues with satellite based FNR Ratio: errors in satellite retrievals, lack of vertically resolved data, use of constant FNR thresholds on satellite retrievals may increase uncertainty.
6. Major issue: uncertain correlation between HCHO and surface level organic reactivity. (for it to act as proxy to VOCs)
7. Relative impact of meteorological conditions on ozone production is less in dry areas.
8. Paper investigated the change in ozone regime during COVID19 lockdown. 
9. Data Quality - No discussion on cloud cover. QA as used in GEE L3.
